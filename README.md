# Timed-Math-GAME
The timed math game tests your skills with quick math problems. Solve equations within the time limit to advance. Improve mental calculation abilities under pressure!

The game starts by prompting the player to press Enter to begin.

Once the player starts the game, a series of math problems is generated. Each problem consists of two random operands (numbers) and a randomly chosen operator (+, -, or *).

The player is shown the problem and prompted to enter their answer.

If the player enters the correct answer within the time limit (5 seconds per problem), the game proceeds to the next problem.

If the player takes longer than the time limit to answer a problem, a message is displayed indicating that time's up, and the player's incorrect answer count is incremented.

If the player enters an incorrect answer, they are notified and prompted to try again. The incorrect answer count is incremented.

After all the problems have been presented and answered, the game ends.

The player's total time to complete the game is displayed, along with their accuracy score (percentage of correctly answered problems).

The game provides a fun and challenging way to test the player's mental math skills under a time constraint. Players can try to improve their speed and accuracy with each playthrough.
